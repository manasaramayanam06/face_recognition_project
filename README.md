Face Recognition Attendance System:
This project is an AI-powered Attendance System built using Python, OpenCV, and the Face Recognition library.
It detects faces in real-time through a webcam and automatically marks Name, Date, and Time in an Excel file.
Features :
 Real-Time Face Detection using OpenCV
 Recognizes known faces stored in the known_faces/ folder
 Automatically records Name, Date, and Time in attendance.xlsx
 Attendance records are saved for future reference
 Fast and efficient recognition using the face_recognition library
 Tech Stack:
Python 
OpenCV  (for real-time image processing)
Face Recognition  (for identifying faces)
Numpy & Pandas  (for data handling)
Excel (openpyxl)  (for attendance storage)
ðŸ“‚ Project Structure:
face_recognition_project/
â”‚â”€â”€ main.py             # Main script for face recognition & attendance
â”‚â”€â”€ requirements.txt    # List of dependencies
â”‚â”€â”€ known_faces/        # Folder containing images of known people
â”‚â”€â”€ attendance.xlsx     # Excel file to store attendance

git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-recognition-attendance.git
cd face-recognition-attendance
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage:
Place images of known people in the known_faces/ folder.
Example: known_faces/John.jpg
Run the project:
python main.py
The camera will start and recognize faces in real-time.
Attendance will be stored in attendance.xlsx.
Example Output:
